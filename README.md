PSIO tools for processing files on linux.

These require binmerge and cue2cu2.py, wc, and unzip in your PATH

multibinner.sh - extracts a series of zip files with bin/cue and convert to bin/cu2 format. Supports single or multi-bin files.

multidiscer.sh - converts multi-disc games into a single folder. I advise separating out the games you wish to process before running this. It expects them to have (Disc #) in the folder name

multilister.sh - creates a MULTIDISC.LST file in every folder. Also adds GameShark 5 (edit to change or remove this)
